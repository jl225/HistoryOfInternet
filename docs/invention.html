                    The Internet enables millions of people with personal computers to communicate and connect to one another.
                    It is also the world’s largest marketplace. But what is it? In simplest terms, the Internet can be described
                    as a global network for computer based communication. Although we may take it for granted nowadays, its creation
                    was something no one could have forseen. This is because computers during the 1950's were these bulky and very expensive
                    machines that ordinary people would only see in Science-Fiction movies. The first person in recorded history who came up
                    with the idea for a global networking system  was Dr. Joseph Carl Robnett Licklider in the 1950s. Understanding why he
                    came up with the concept requires a bit of historical context.

                    During this time period, the United States and the Soviet Union were locked in an indirect war. This conflict was known as
                    the Cold War. Unlike other wars, however, this one was not fought solely on battlefields. The Cold War was also a battle of
                    technological and scientific advancements. So when the Soviet Union launched the spacecraft Sputnik and became the first people
                    in space, President Eisenhower created the Advanced Research Projects Agency (ARPA), which had the goal of advancing technology
                    for space exploration and computer science. While space exploration would soon fall under NASA, ARPA was tasked with advancing
                    computer science.

                </p>
                <p>
                    Dr. Paul Baran of the Research and Development Corporation (RAND Corp.) was asked by the U.S. Government to create a permanent
                    system of communication that could be used if telephone lines were ever to be destroyed by a Soviet attack. His solution to this
                    was a computerized process known as Packet Switching. It worked by breaking down information into small pieces refered to as packets,
                    which would then sent through a network. Once all the packets arrived to their destination, they would rejoin and produce the information
                    initially sent. Despite numerous issues with the system, Baran and his team were able to make it work. Due to this innovation, the thought
                    that a computer network could be used as a backup or even replacement to the telephone was a somewhat reasonable possibility. Over time,
                    many aspiring and intellegent engineers would continue to innovate computer based communication. Bob Taylor is one such person.


                </p>
                <p>
                    In 1966, Bob Taylor of ARPA rationalized that computers around the country were capable of sharing the same terminal if they were using a
                    singular network. He managed to convince his boss at the time to fund a network project and acquired one million dollars to realize his idea.
                    Larry Roberts, a well regarded graduate of MIT, was recruited by Taylor in order to succeed in this endeavor. Roberts came up with the idea
                    to have each computer linked with smaller messenger computers called interface Message Processors (IMPs) that would speak with other IMPs.
                    This method would prevent the computers from needing to be linked with every single other computer they wished to communicate with. The large
                    communication companies at the time were very doubtful of the success of this project and refused to assist ARPA. However, a small company by
                    the name of Bolt, Berenek, and Newman (BBN) did agree to help push the project off the ground. Despite numerous issues during the development
                    period of the project, ARPA was abel to successfully communicate across four different testing sites using their new network, by the end of
                    1969.

                </p>
                <p>
                    The ARPANET was released and proved to be successful. It would soon become quite popular with the creation of the first electronic-mail (E-mail)
                    software in 1967. By the end of 1969, coincendently the same year the Apollo-11 astronauts reached the surface of the Moon, the ARPANet was fully
                    implemented. Three years later, ARPA demonstrated their network to the higher ups in Washington D.C. Soon more innovations were made to the network.
                    Robert Khan and Vinton Cerf collaborated in creating the Internet Protocol Suite (Transmission Control Protocol and the Internet Protocol: TCP/IP)
                    which allowed the different networks to interconnect and served as a universal ruleset, public networks like prodigy.com and America Online rose to
                    prominence, and Tim Burner Lee would go on to creating software that made accessing information on the internet easy, now known as the World Wide Web.
                    Despite what the doubters claimed years earlier, ARPA managed to make a communication network which would grow into the most important invention of
                    recent time.
