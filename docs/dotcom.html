                    Amazon was founded by Jeff Besos. Originally from the Wall Streets he wanted to build something online to sell.  He did a very detailed business plan, market analysis and research. But they had to replan the business model due to the fast pace changes of the market with newer customer base who does online shopping.
                    Software programmer pierre came up with ebay for place to do business. He was not interested
                    in research and lists of affective market. The website was first developed to list an item,
                    search for an item, and bid on an item.
                    Both companies had an exponential growth. This industry is unique for the quality that takes few steps
                    are taken to have immense amount of growth.

                    Microprocessors designers were developing transistors to be smaller and faster.
                    The Moore’s law of counteractivity: technology grows exponentially even with small furtherment of breakthrough or number of users.
                    Growth of internet gathers moment as number of users increase the usefulness of the network and value increases which makes the internet more and more compelling.

                    Breakthrough of technology attracts investors for gains which led to a crash.
                    Jeff Besos called Amazon as world’s largest bookstore using his environment as an advantage. Stocks skyrocketed with hoping to benefit from the company’s potential. Tremendously controversial. Most of the profits were sacrificed for the company’s growth due to Besos’s strategy was to expand his business as fast as he could. Convinced customers to trust them with credentials and information. Mathematicians were hired to develop to encryption. Several years were put into digital encryption to be used like padlock boxes. Public key is used for rendering secret data that has been set to the sender. The private key is used by the receiver to take the encrypted data and decrypt them when needed.
                    Ebay was used by collectors around the world. Meg Whitman was recruited by investors who is a former member Disney marketing team and an executive at the toy company Hasbro. Stock soared on the opening day as an IPO.
                    Some financial experts pointed out amazon will double their income within a year. Dot com bubble has started at the same time.

                    Day traders were buying stocks in the morning and selling them at nights. Hundreds of people gathered to Silicon Valley to start up their own tech business spending millions of dollars off the dot com bubble. It was a very energetic frenzy time and is said to be a time many lost their sense of judgement. Professionals on Wall Street were at a dilemma and even if they knew there might be a stock market crash many were in a tough position not to be in part to make money off the Dot com bubble. Even if they knew companies don’t have a future potential, they were putting down money for the short term profit. That’s how the Dot com bubble was taken place.
                    Telecommunications was one of the sectors that companies were trying hard to pursue in as well as Ecommerce. Using communication methods like morse codes, the internet allowed the massive amount of data and information to be access by everyone.
                    Market gap get way ahead of what the company could deliver. Many started to get worried about meeting expectation or even the fact that they will face the consequences of the crash.
                    The fed raises the interest to put the bubble to an end.

                    Wall street was blamed for the immense amount of loss of the economy. Many Ecommerce that did survive however, was able to become the leading companies of the sector. Ebay and Amazon was early and aggressive therefore they succeeded. Fundamentally they took different approach to this business model than what the textbook says.
                    Ebay gave the users the freedom to control how the market worked and focused on what the people wanted.
                    Amazon took the approach to empower their company which is similar to Ebay. Sometimes this made the suppliers and publishures complain about the customer’s honest reviews. Amazon did not care about the complaint of their suppliers because their job was to satisfy their customers. Setting the new standards for customer service was their mission.
                    Entering the golden age of web, the Dot com bubble was necessary to a certain point that the companies and investors are aware of what they did wrong in the past. This also tells us the true power of the web and the Ecommerce for surviving an economic crash and still being the leaders of the industry to this day
