                    During the early days of the Internet, before the World Wide Web was created, there were very few web pages
                    and those web pages would consist of nothing but bulky walls of text. However, the next important development
                    in the history of the Internet would soon arrive and change that: Mosaic. Mosaic was a free to download web browser
                    that would propel the Internet’s accessibility to great heights. It was created by Marc Andreesen in 1993 with the
                    intent to make browsing through the internet very easy to use and understand to those who may not have much knowledge
                    on computers. James Clark, the founder of Silicone Graphics, saw a business opportunity with Mosaic and reached out
                    to Andreesen in order to create a new company. However, many did not think that there was any profit to be gained with
                    web browsers, not even Bill Gates, one of the co-founders of the tech giant Microsoft.

                </p>
                <p>
                    Bill Gates’ life goal was to monopolize the computer industry with his Personal Computers (PCs) and Windows software.
                    With Paul Balmer by his side, Gates was doing all he could so that Microsoft would never be outdone by a group of young,
                    eager programmers like Gates was when he first started the company. He would use any means necessary in order to ensure that.
                    Netscape, the company which Clark and Andreseen founded, was tasked with creating a new graphical web browser, one that would
                    propel the Internet commercially and enhance communication over the web. Some Microsoft executives who saw the potential of
                    Netscape attempted to reach out to them in order to learn more about what they were doing. However, the employees at Netscape
                    refused every offer the executives gave. Netscape knew that Microsoft was going to be their biggest competitor.


                </p>
                <p>
                    Navigation, Netscape’s newest browser, was released on December 15th, 1994. Microsoft feared that web browsers would become an
                    alternative platform for softwares, which would leave the Windows Operating System discarded into irrelevance. With Netscape’s
                    success, Bill Gates realized how badly he underestimated the potential of web browsers. In order to rectify his initial blunder,
                    he sent orders to his employees to find ways to innovate what they have, and outmatch what Netscape is able to do. This started
                    the Browser Wars.

                </p>
                <p>
                    Gates sent some Microsoft representatives to meet with Netscape. According to Microsoft employees, they were discussing how the
                    two companies could benefit from each other to create a better user-experience that would allow for profits for both sides. However,
                    according to Netscape employees, the meeting was far less pleasant and involved Microsoft threatening Netscape and offering them
                    a lowly sum of one million dollars for their company. These threats broke Antitrust laws in the United States, and so Netscape took
                    legal action. After only one year as a company, and despite not making any profits yet, Netscape went public with their browser
                    named Navigation, which would lead a large rise in their stock value as well as a large increase in the internet’s popularity.
                    Netscape co-founder Marc Andreseen was caught up in his own success and began to openly gloat about it. He even made some very negative
                    comments towards Bill Gates and Microsoft. This spurred Microsoft's employees and motivated them, leading to their own browser, Internet
                    Explorer.

                </p>
                <p>
                    With their larger pool of financial resources, great programming talent, and some under-handed tactics, Microsoft was able to catch up to
                    Netscape. A large deciding factor in this war was that Microsoft was able to afford to make Internet Explorer a free product, unlike Netscape’s
                    Navigation which had to be paid for to use. By September of 1997, Microsoft officially won the Browser Wars and Netscape would eventually be
                    bought by AOL. Although Netscape lost the Browser War, those involved in the creation of Navigation got millions of dollars from it and so they at
                    least succeeded from a financial standpoint. However, Microsoft would find themselves in legal trouble. In 1998, Congress sued Microsoft. They accused
                    the company of using “predatory and exclusionary” business tactics to put Netscape out of business. The federal Judge ruled Microsoft guilty of
                    these crimes, and wanted Microsoft broken into two seperate companies. However, they took the case to a Court of Appeals and the order to split the
                    company was rescinded. After the case, perhaps with a new perspective on life, Gates gave control of the company to Paul Baulmer and began funding
                    humanitarian work for many causes.
