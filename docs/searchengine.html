                <p>Fifteen years before the creation and rise of Google, there were no ways to search the Internet.
                    Jerry Yang and David Filo, two “slacker” students from Stanford University, were the founders of the eventual tech giant Yahoo!. The catalyst for their venture was their desire to find the statistics of Basketball players for a fantasy league.
                    This would lead to the creation of a directory which would help inexperienced web users navigate the Internet to a variety of “cool” things”. This directory was first called Jerry and David's Guide to the World Wide Web but would later be changed to Yahoo!.
                    Early Internet culture was undefined, and so people at the time were conflicted as to whether or not advertisement should be allowed on it. David and Jerry decided to allow advertisements to run on their website, despite their concern that it could lead to their users feeling alienated or even that their users would rebel. The advertisements ended up not at all discouraging Yahoo!’s users from using their site. It would continue to grow which would allow for even more advertisers to pay David and Jerry to put up their ads. Yahoo!’s success in 1995 was the first instance of anyone making money on the web.

                <p>
                    Yahoo’s first major obstacle was the rival company: Excite, who had a more efficient search engine which resembles what we use in modern day. Eventually, Yahoo!, Excite, and other search engines focused more on advertising than they did improving their software.
                    In 1998, Larry Page and Sergey Brin created Google using the rationale that search engines should sort web pages by relevance. How relevant a web page is determined by how many times that web page is linked. Excite venture partners had a meeting with Page and Brin so that Google could be bought out by them. However, the employees at Excite were unimpressed with Google, so the deal fell through. Every company in Silicon Valley also rejected Google’s offers because they didn’t think that Google was profitable enough to warrant being bought out.

                    The company google was encouraged by Andy and other investors with million dollars invested in the company. Some investors were very much convinced on the company’s future value. 10 billion revenue was expected enormous opportunity.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Early part of 1999, investors were getting nervous and the company’s services and equipment called for financial support. This seemed like the only way to survive for google was to follow other search engine portal to put banner ads and pop ups which hurts the quality of the user experience. But google at the time did their best to take a different approach. Advertising was desired to be more user friendly and neatly presented.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Bill Gross was the one responsible for these web developments of user-friendly advertisement that led google to beginning of success. He was the founder of Idealab. Search engine is the world’s most powerful market research tool. Key words are the future of the business. The words that user’s type are insanely valuable asset to sell to advertisers. He launched a website named overture based on keywords and sponsored links. Instance success was brought by this certain product which made revenue of billions. Business model was being constructed through these processes while google had made their own business mode which was identical as what Gross developed.  Gross sued google but came to an agreement as the stock prices of google went up and Gross stopped fighting. Sponsered links were in better user experience and boost company revenue. This led to a certain boom of internet advertising business which leads into the notorious Dotcom Bubble.

                    Wallstreet benefited a lot but controversy arose from how google as a company does business receiving bad reviews and discouragement. Google IPO was a popular topic among investors. Trades went up to hundred dollars and never went down. Google was the fastest growing company than ever before. Until advertising was a successful business model, companies could never afford to pay for internet programmers within their reach. People started fearing for data that is stored in google’s database. This business model was targeted by many competitors and is google’s job to strategize ways to survive in the industry.
