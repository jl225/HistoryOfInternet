                    The company google was encouraged by Andy and other investors with million dollars invested in the company. Some investors were very much convinced on the company’s future value. 10 billion revenue was expected enormous opportunity.

                    Early part of 1999, investors were getting nervous and the company’s services and equipment called for financial support. This seemed like the only way to survive for google was to follow other search engine portal to put banner ads and pop ups which hurts the quality of the user experience. But google at the time did their best to take a different approach. Advertising was desired to be more user friendly and neatly presented.

                    Bill Gross was the one responsible for these web developments of user-friendly advertisement that led google to beginning of success. He was the founder of Idealab. Search engine is the world’s most powerful market research tool. Key words are the future of the business. The words that user’s type are insanely valuable asset to sell to advertisers. He launched a website named overture based on keywords and sponsored links. Instance success was brought by this certain product which made revenue of billions. Business model was being constructed through these processes while google had made their own business mode which was identical as what Gross developed.  Gross sued google but came to an agreement as the stock prices of google went up and Gross stopped fighting. Sponsered links were in better user experience and boost company revenue. This led to a certain boom of internet advertising business which leads into the notorious Dotcom Bubble.

                    Wallstreet benefited a lot but controversy arose from how google as a company does business receiving bad reviews and discouragement. Google IPO was a popular topic among investors. Trades went up to hundred dollars and never went down. Google was the fastest growing company than ever before. Until advertising was a successful business model, companies could never afford to pay for internet programmers within their reach. People started fearing for data that is stored in google’s database. This business model was targeted by many competitors and is google’s job to strategize ways to survive in the industry.
