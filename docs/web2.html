Hollywood and industry used this platform as a marketing opportunity. Facebook had the start off at a very good time where the internet was accessible to everyone. Mark Zuckerburg thought to embody the relationships that the people want to have by improving user experience. Media revolution has improved all our lives to be more convenient and easier. The power of technological advancement has impressed and appealed to the public. Mp3 provided a way to compress media data to be stored and played on their pc and even online. Mark open this website for Harvard students to access and use as a communicating platform. This website then became a phenomenon as more college’s students wanted this website to be available for them. Mark Zuckrberg had the ambition to create the service that capture the totality of
                    human connectedness. Create the ultimate relationship engine.

                    Mapping out people’s relationships around the world is called Social Graph (social network analysis). This states that we are connected by the web of relationships. Sometimes direct ties sometimes not whether strong or weak. Zuckerberg desired Facebook to be the windows of the web.

                    Pier to pier network system let people share files and download them using the program Napster. This became one of the biggest controversies of technological advances in the history of the internet. CD shops were closing as Napster became the fastest spreading software ever at the time. Hilary Rosen wanted to contact Fanning wanting to take Napster down for illegal file sharing.
                    This became a huge threat to the value of intellectual properties and the business that was involved. The protection from the copywrite law was being threatened. Music industry forbid and detested the idea of downloading music without having to pay for CDs and records. They soon found out that the public did not care, and the music industry was left with no choice but to adapt with these new changes. Along with this revolution, Youtube gain more and more popularity and success.

                </p>
                <p>
                    Napster was shut down after the court case of copywrite issues and iTunes was given the permission to provide music files that cost 99 cents apiece. Youtube became a part of this issue as another threat to the music industry. This was a tougher case for the music industry to win because Youtube was already a huge platform powered by google. The internet gives people the opportunity for entertainment produced by themselves rather than contents that big industries want to sell. New era emerged as the internet presented the entertainment created by the crowd. This Era is known as Web 2 .0.
